                  1.In a mixing bowl, add whole wheat flour and salt (if
                  desired). Mix well.
                  <br></br>
                  2.Slowly add water and knead the flour to form a smooth dough.
                  The consistency should not be too soft or too hard.
                  <br></br>
                  3.Divide the dough into small portions and shape them into
                  balls.
                  <br></br>
                  4.Roll out each ball into a thin, round roti using a rolling
                  pin and a lightly floured surface..
                  <br></br>
                  5.Heat a tawa (flat griddle) or a non-stick pan over
                  medium-high heat.
                  <br></br>
                  6.Place the rolled roti on the hot tawa and cook until small
                  bubbles start to form on the surface.
                  <br></br>
                  7.Flip the roti and cook the other side until it puffs up and
                  has golden spots.
                  <br></br>
                  8.Remove the roti from the pan and repeat the process for the
                  remaining dough.
